## Projects

**NFL Game Predictions Machine Learning Model**\
• Collected and processed NFL play-by-play data (2019-2024) using nfl-data-py and pandas, aggregating key team statistics at the game level.\
• Engineered predictive features, including rolling averages of offensive and defensive metrics, turnovers, penalties, special teams, and efficiency stats.\
• Developed a random forest model with sklearn to predict game outcomes, training on calculated feature differentials between competing teams.

**NBA Player Archetype Clustering**\
• Developed an NBA player clustering model using K-Means, PCA, and standardized stats from the NBA API.\
• Visualized player archetypes with interactive plots using Plotly and Matplotlib.

**Experimental Design Project**\
• Performed a randomized complete block design study in R to analyze carbonation levels across three soda brands.\
• Carried out ANOVA testing and rigorously evaluated ANOVA assumptions, leading to robust conclusions on the\
most effective treatment for achieving maximum carbonation.
